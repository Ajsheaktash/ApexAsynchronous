1. Create 100 test leads using the future method that has
names like test 1, test 2, test 3 etc. to use in the schedulable and
queueable apex jobs

        list<lead> multilead=new List<lead>();

2.Update these 100 test leads description as < This lead is
updated using Queuable Apex > via the queuable apex method.

///////////
public class updateleadqueueable implements Queueable{
    public void execute(QueueableContext QC){
        List<lead> multilead=[Select id,Description,LastName, Company from lead where LastName like '%test%'];

3.We add the term 'test' to the names of the leads we have
created for testing purposes in order to distinguish them from
real leads in a comfortable way, and we want to avoid
unnecessary congestion in the system by deleting these test
leads every Friday at 20:30.


public class deleteleadSchedule implements Schedulable {
    public void execute(schedulableContext SC){
        list<lead> multilead=[Select id,Description,LastName, Company from lead where LastName like '%test%'];
        delete multilead;
    }
    

}

4.. We have about 60000 Opportunities on the salesforce and 
we want to update all of their close dates as one month later 
than today. How can we do it? 


public class oppbatchapex implements Database.Batchable<sObject>{
    public Database.QueryLocator start(Database.BatchableContext BC){
        return Database.getQueryLocator('Select id,Name, CloseDate,StageName from Opportunity');
    }
    public void execute(Database.BatchableContext BC, list<opportunity> opplist){
        for(Opportunity opp:opplist){
            opp.CloseDate= date.today()+30;
        }
        update opplist;
    }
    public void finish(Database.BatchableContext BC){
        system.debug( 'lead batch is finished');
    }

}
